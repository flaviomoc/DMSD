\details{
Alpha calculations use a tree-based approach for TD, FD, and
PD (Cardoso et al. 2014). In the FD calculation, a species
traits matrix is transformed into a distance matrix and
clustered to create a regional dendrogram (i.e. a
dendrogram with all species in the raster stack),
from which the total branch length is calculated. When
computing FD for each community (i.e. raster cell), the
regional dendrogram is subsetted to create a local dendrogram
that includes only the species present in the local community.
The branch lengths connecting these species are then summed to
represent the functional relationships of the locally present
species (Petchey and Gaston, 2002, 2006). Similarly, in PD,
the cumulative branch lengths connecting species within a
community indicate their shared phylogenetic relationships
(Faith, 1992). Alpha TD can also be visualized using a tree
diagram, where each species is directly connected to the root
by an edge of unit length, reflecting the number of different
taxa in the community (i.e. species richness) since all taxa
are at the same level (Cardoso et al. 2014).
